# Training-a-smartcab-to-drive-Reinforcement-Learning
This project uses the Reinforcement Learning techniques - Q-Learning in particualar to train a smart cab to drive in an environment simulating the real-world environment. The goal is to have an optimal policy of actions for the smartcab at each state based on its environment conditions - Traffic Lights and surrounding cars
